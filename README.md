### Cosine Similarity based plagarism analyser 

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents
are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the
angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The
cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar
documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the
document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The
smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

## Example:

doc_Vidit = " Vidit Gujrathi (born 24 October 1994) is an
Indian chess player. He attained the title of Grandmaster in January
2013, becoming the 30th player from India to do so. He is currently
the third highest rated player in India (behind Anand and
Harikrishna), and is the fourth Indian player to have crossed the Elo
rating threshold of 2700."


doc_Vishi Anand = " Viswanathan Anand (born 11 December 1969) is
an Indian chess grandmaster and former world chess champion. He
became the first grandmaster from India in 1988, and is one of the few
players to have surpassed an Elo rating of 2800, a feat he first
achieved in 2006."
doc_Chess = “Chess is a game based on strategy and warfare
techniques involving a lot of rules. It is good to improve concentration
and logical thinking.”



doc_Queen = " Vidit Gujrathi (born 24 October 1994) is an
Indian chess player. He attained the title of Grandmaster in January
2013, becoming the 30th player from India to do so."
